## Columns

| # | Column | Type | Flags | Description |
|--:|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `PAT_ID` | VARCHAR | PK FK→ | The unique ID of the patient record for this row. This column is frequently used to link to the PATIENT table. |
| 2 | `RESIDENCE_CODE_C_NAME` | VARCHAR | org | This item is intended to store the patient's residence code. It was developed to meet New Jersey reporting requirements. It identifies a patient's municipality in a way more specific to the state than zip code alone. |

_Flags: PK = primary key · org = may contain organization-specific values · discont. = discontinued · FK→ = inferred reference (see below) · shared = generic key, intentionally unresolved._
