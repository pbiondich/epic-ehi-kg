## Columns

| # | Column | Type | Flags | Description |
|--:|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `PAT_ENC_CSN_ID` | NUMERIC | PK FK→ | The unique contact serial number for this contact. This number is unique across all patient encounters in your system. If you use IntraConnect, this is the Unique Contact Identifier (UCI). |
| 2 | `LINE` | INTEGER | PK | The line number for the information associated with this record. Multiple pieces of information can be associated with this record. |
| 3 | `PAT_ENC_DATE_REAL` | FLOAT |  | A unique contact date in decimal format. The integer portion of the number indicates the date of the contact. The digits after the decimal distinguish different contacts on the same date and are unique for each contact on that date. For example, .00 is the first/only contact, .01 is the second contact, etc. |
| 4 | `CONTACT_DATE` | DATETIME |  | The date of this contact in calendar format. |
| 5 | `SELECTED_SSET_ID` | NUMERIC |  | The unique ID of a SmartSet (a collection of orders and other clinical content) that was used in this encounter. |
| 6 | `SELECTED_SSET_ID_PROTOCOL_NAME` | VARCHAR |  | The SmartSet/Protocol record name. This is different from the display name, which is stored in CL_PRL_SS_OT.DISPLAY_NAME. |
| 7 | `SELECTED_SSET_DAT` | NUMERIC |  | A unique, internal contact date in decimal format for the version of the SmartSet used in this encounter. The integer portion of the number indicates the date of the contact. The digits after the decimal distinguish different contacts on the same date and are unique for each contact on that date. For example, .00 is the first/only contact, .01 is the second contact, etc. |
| 8 | `SELECTED_SSET_SIGN_GROUP_IDENT` | INTEGER |  | Unique identifier shared by other rows in the EPT_SEL_SMARTSETS table signifying a group of SmartSets that were signed at the same time. |
