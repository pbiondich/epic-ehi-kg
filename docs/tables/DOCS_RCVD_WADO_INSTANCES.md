## Columns

| # | Column | Type | Flags | Description |
|--:|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `DOCUMENT_ID` | NUMERIC | PK shared | The unique identifier (.1 item) for the document record. |
| 2 | `CONTACT_DATE_REAL` | FLOAT | PK | A unique contact date in decimal format. The integer portion of the number indicates the date of contact.

For example, .00 is the first/only contact, .01 is the second contact, etc. |
| 3 | `GROUP_LINE` | INTEGER | PK | The line number for the information associated with this contact. |
| 4 | `VALUE_LINE` | INTEGER | PK | The line number of one of the multiple values associated with a specific group of data within this contact. |
| 5 | `CONTACT_DATE` | DATETIME |  | The date of this contact in calendar format. |
| 6 | `INSTANCE_IDENT` | VARCHAR |  | An Imaging Study retrieval is made up of one or more WADO-RS requests. Each line in this related group represents an individual request. This item holds each of the instance UIDs included in the WADO-RS query string. It corresponds to the DICOM instance UID (I DCM 3000) in the corresponding DCM record. |
