> For each order in an advanced order group in a treatment day, this table will store the sequence number for that order. Sequence numbers are used to determine the position in the day to add the order when it is added to the day.

**Primary key:** `REGIMEN_ID`, `CONTACT_DATE_REAL`, `GROUP_LINE`, `VALUE_LINE`  
**Columns:** 6

## Columns

| # | Column | Type | Flags | Description |
|--:|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `REGIMEN_ID` | NUMERIC | PK shared | The unique identifier for the patient order group record. |
| 2 | `CONTACT_DATE_REAL` | FLOAT | PK | A unique contact date in decimal format. The integer portion of the number indicates the date of contact.

| 3 | `GROUP_LINE` | INTEGER | PK | The line number for the information associated with this contact. |
| 4 | `VALUE_LINE` | INTEGER | PK | The line number of one of the multiple values associated with a specific group of data within this contact. |
| 5 | `CONTACT_DT` | DATETIME |  | The date of this contact in calendar format. |
| 6 | `AOG_ORDER_RANK` | INTEGER |  | Stores the position of this order in the protocol day. |
